Welcome! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

Hello! I’m passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and Hardware.

I’m particularly intrigued by the power of generative AI to help others resolve issues more efficiently.
My aim is to develop automation frameworks that streamline deployment processes while ensuring we meet our Service Level Objectives (SLOs) through effective observability and metrics.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy keeping up with the latest advancements in AI, exploring the world of hacking, and delving into the domains of hardware and firmware.
