### Welcome! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Stevie**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steviepreston/), a AI-based software engineer from Belfast, Northern Ireland.

I'm primarily interested in **Artifcal Intelligence** and **SRE**.

I'm currently work as a software engineer at the [**@BT Group**](https://www.bt.com/about).

I'm fascinated by utilzing generative AI to help others teams solve route issues quicker and automate resoultions, via producing automation frameworks to help maintain SLO's.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of all things AI, Hacking and Operating Systems.
